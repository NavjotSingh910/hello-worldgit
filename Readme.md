# hello-world
Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.


 git status

 git add index.html
git add --all
git add -A


git status --short //for see changes in short form

//Note: Short status flags are:

            ?? - Untracked files
            A - Files added to stage
            M - Modified files
            D - Deleted files


git commit -m "Message"
git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line without staging"

//history of commits 
git log
git log --oneline

//help command
git command -help //-  See all the available options for the specific command
git help --all //-  See all possible commands

//branches
git branch hello-world-images
git branch //see how many branches are there 
-b option on checkout 
git branch -d  branchname //delete branch

git merge branchname

//connect git hub make repo and copy link 
 git remote add origin https://github.com/NavjotSingh910/test.git //create remote Git repository named "origin"
 
 git push --set-upstream origin master 
 git remote rm origin //delete origin
 git remote rename origin upstream
 git remote -v //all remote name
 git remote set-url origin git@github.com:w3schools-test/hello-world.git //set new url
 
 //pull is a combination of 2 different commands:
       fetch
       merge
git fetch origin
git log origin/master

git diff origin/master  //differences between our local master and origin/master
git merge origin/master


git pull origin //Use pull to update our local Git
//if it give you error it mean you delete origin in past so there are the 2 solution of this

        1. git pull origin master
        2.git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/BRANCH_NAME

//push
git push origin

//github branches
git branch -a
git branch -r //only for remote branches

//push branch on git hub

git push origin update-readme



//The GitHub flow works like this:

       Create a new Branch
       Make changes and add Commits
       Open a Pull Request
       Review
       Deploy
       Merge


Test for single file commit
and here we go test completed and yes we can do this also 

//important commands


git add --exclude exclude.txt //This tells Git to add all files in the current directory (.) to the staging area,except for exclude.txt

git reset exclude.txt //if we add by mistake in staging area means ready for commit then  remove from it staging area but it still  
                        tracked by git

git rm --cached exclude.txt //cached  means git remove it from tracking  file but dont delete from directory 

git rm exclude.txt //cached  means git remove it from tracking  file and also delete from directory 

touch .gitignore

 git restore index.html
git revert 142f4f6 --no-edit
git reset 9a9add8
 git checkout a3e058f
